# KatieAnthon-ChicagoSocioeconomicDataAnalysis

In this project I have used multiple sql queries to investigate the chicago socioeconomic data

I have created 3 graphs displaying the correlation between household income and hardship index, households under the poverty line and the percentage of those 16 and unemployed
